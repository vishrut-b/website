    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I was born in a town called <strong>Jorhat</strong> located in the northeastern state of <strong>Assam</strong> in India. Despite having lived most of my formative years in Guwahati, a larger (and noisier) city
      in Assam, my roots remain quietly anchored in Jorhat — a place of slower days, the earthy scent of rain-soaked soil lingering after heavy downpours, and memories of times spent with 
      grandparents, visceral <em>Śākta</em> ceremonies, and sunlit cricket matches with cousins in the courtyard.</p>

    <p>My academic journey couldn’t have been more different. Anyone who ends up becoming an astronomer or astrophysicist can almost always trace it back to a 
      childhood memory of being taken to the city planetarium by a parent — and mine was no exception. My father had me memorizing the names of the planets 
      in our solar system when I was barely five, handed me <em>A Brief History of Time</em> when I was thirteen, and spent countless nights diving into astronomy chapters from encyclopaedias with me.
